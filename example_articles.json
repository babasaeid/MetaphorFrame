A new Wall Street Journal survey finds that Americans still overwhelmingly think President Biden is too old to serve another four years, still believe the economy is doing poorly, still feel bedeviled by inflation and high prices, and are not itching to sign up for another four years of Biden. In fact, in normal circumstances, the incumbent would look doomed . . . except the same survey also finds that Republican primary voters remain hell-bent on nominating Donald Trump again, leaving the race a toss-up.\n\nStalemate in the States\nRight now the Democratic Party is going all-in on the health, competence, and popularity of an incumbent president who turns 81 in a few months, who is seen favorably by only 39 percent of the voting public, and whose argument that “Bidenomics” is a modern-day success story has been thoroughly rejected by a majority of the electorate.\n\nThe new Wall Street Journal survey results released Monday paint a picture of a first-term president who, at first glance, looks like a long shot for a second term:\nAlthough the candidates are only three years apart, 73 percent of voters said they feel Biden is too old to seek a second term, compared with 47 percent of voters who said the same of the 77-year-old Trump. Two-thirds of Democrats said Biden was too old to run again.\n\nBy an 11-point margin, more voters see Trump rather than Biden as having a record of accomplishments as president — some 40 percent said Biden has such a record, while 51 percent said so of Trump. By an eight-point margin, more voters said Trump has a vision for the future. And by 10 points, more described Trump as mentally up to the presidency. Some 46 percent said that is true of Trump, compared with 36% who said so of Biden.\n\nNor is this new WSJ survey out of line with the rest of the national public-opinion surveys; Biden’s job-approval rating remains around 40 percent in the FiveThirtyEight average of all polling. Public attitudes about Biden really haven’t changed much since they worsened in late summer and autumn of 2021, after the debacle of the withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nThis summer, the president started touting the state of the economy and talking up “Bidenomics.” Usually, a president wants to take credit for an economy that people like; Biden is running around taking credit for an economy that Americans believe is getting worse. The survey found, “58 percent of voters say the economy has gotten worse over the past two years, whereas only 28 percent say it has gotten better, and nearly three in four say inflation is headed in the wrong direction.” Just 37 percent of registered voters said they approved of the job Biden was doing on the economy, and 59 percent disapproved. The numbers were even worse on inflation, with just 34 percent approving, and 63 percent disapproving.\n\nMany Americans believe that inflation never went away. When this is pointed out, you’ll find some Democrats denouncing the electorate for perceiving the economy incorrectly. But credit-card debt recently hit a new record, which is an indicator that Americans are still having a hard time paying those new higher prices. The U.S. Department of Agriculture states, “Food prices are expected to grow more slowly in 2023 than in 2022 but still at above historical-average rates. In 2023, all food prices are predicted to increase 5.9 percent, with a prediction interval of 5.3 to 6.5 percent.” If people are paying about 6 percent more than they paid last year to eat, it is not surprising that they’re not rating the economy highly. And also note that gas prices are high by historical standards; last month, the national average for a gallon of gas was $3.95.\n\n Volodymyr Zelenskyy has flown to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on the eve of separate, high-stakes meetings between Ukrainian and US officials at a time when Ukraine is being squeezed on and off the battlefield.\n\nBin Salman’s government has played a mediating role between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nDonald Trump has sought to force Zelenskyy to agree to a deal to end the war with Russia, and last week the US president piled on the pressure by cutting off crucial military assistance and intelligence-sharing."
